# black-line-follower
it is an automated guided vehicle, which follow a visual line embedded on the floor or ceiling. 
Usually, the visual line is the path in which the line follower robot goes and it will be a black line on a white surface but the other way (white line on a black surface) is also possible.

# caution-to-take-care
After setting up the circuit , make sure to adjust the variable resistance of the IR Sensor such that both the left & right IR sensors read the same value ,to make sure it does keep it to the level of ground and change the knob of variable resistance to set it equal.
If the above step is perfect there will be less confusions and problems you are to face.
The code works perfect with its test proved in the mp4 file in the repository.
